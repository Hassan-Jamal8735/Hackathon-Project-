# Project Team and Contribution Breakdown

TruthShield was developed by a specialized team of four members, each contributing to distinct areas of the project life cycle, from architectural design to implementation and verification.

### Team Members and Roles

**1. Muhammad Hassan Jamal (Lead Technical Architect & Backend Developer)**
Directed the overall system architecture and oversaw the integration of core services. Responsible for the implementation of the backend infrastructure, including serverless function orchestration and database schema design. Managed the robust integration of secondary fallback APIs and optimized data persistence workflows.

**2. Ayesha Ali (Frontend Engineer & UI/UX Specialist)**
Spearheaded the development of the primary user interface and dashboard. Executed the transition to the premium enterprise design system, ensuring responsive layouts and high-performance rendering across all modules. Developed the interactive analysis visualization components and managed client-side state for complex document processing flows.

**3. Fiza Mushaim (Systems Analyst & Data Integration Engineer)**
Focused on the development and optimization of the document processing pipeline. Owned the integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) services and the refinement of text extraction algorithms. Conducted extensive testing on document parsing consistency and managed the logic for contextual data categorization.

**4. Ali Hunain (Quality Assurance & Legal Compliance Research)**
Managed the verification framework for AI analysis results and legal guidance accuracy. Conducted the foundational research into Indian legal frameworks (IPC, IT Act) to ensure the generated advice remained practically applicable. Responsible for comprehensive end-to-end testing, bug identification, and ensuring the platform met production-grade stability standards.

### Task Allocation

The team followed a modular development approach:
- **Architecture and Backend**: Defined the communication protocols between the client application and cloud services.
- **Frontend Development**: Implemented the secure authentication system, upload interface, and detailed analysis view.
- **Service Integration**: Configured and optimized the generative analysis models and extraction workers.
- **Compliance and Verification**: Audited the AI-generated responses for reliability and performed rigorous stability testing on the integrated pipeline.
